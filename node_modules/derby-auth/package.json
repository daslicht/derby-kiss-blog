Domain defaults to localhost:3000, but consider it required\n    // (It's a Passport technicality, if anyone has suggestions for determining domain on run-time, please message me)\n    options = {\n        domain: (process.env.NODE_ENV==='production' ? \"http://my.com\" : \"http://localhost:3000\" )\n    }\n```\n\n###Step 2\nUse derby-auth's mounted middleware\n```javascript\n.use(store.modelMiddleware())\n// derby-auth.middleware is inserted after modelMiddleware and before the app router to pass server accessible data to a model\n.use(auth(store, strategies, options))\n.use(app.router())\n```\n\n###Step 3 (optional, recommended)\nIf you want drop-in Login and Register forms, including form validation, use the `<derby-auth:login />` and `<derby-auth:register />` [components](http://derbyjs.com/#component_libraries). To enable these, you'll need this in your `/lib/app/index.js` file:\n```javascript\n   derby.use(require('derby-auth/components'));\n```\n\nSee the [example](https://github.com/lefnire/derby-auth/tree/master/example) for more details, as well as login / registration forms, sign-in buttons, etc.\n\n## Roadmap\nSee my [Workflowy](https://workflowy.com/shared/2a5229b2-64b1-8f5c-e649-4b61c0a1e32a/)\n\n## Why not EveryAuth?\nThis project was originally implemented with Everyauth ([see branch](https://github.com/lefnire/derby-auth/tree/everyauth)), but had some issues:\n  1. Every provider had to be implemented individually in code. Passport has an abstraction layer, which is what allows us to pass in Strategy + conf objects in server/index.js for every provider we want enabled.\n  2. Password authentication posed technical difficulties. See the [Google Group discussion](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!topic/derbyjs/JuUqUNd9Rls)",
